#+title: Using GNU's GDB Debugger Explaning Memory Layout And The Stack
#+author: Peter Jay Salzman


* Where Are We Going To Go?
To effectively learn how to use GCB, you must understand frames, which are also
called stack frames because they're the frames that comprise the stack. To learn
about the stack, we need to learn about the memory layout of an executable prog-
ram. The discussion will mainly be theoretical, but to keey things interesting
we'll conclue the chapter with an example of the stack and stack frames using
GDB.

The material learned in this chapter may seem rather theoretical, but it does
serve a few very useful purposes:
    1. Understanding the stack is absolutely necessary for using a symbolic
       debugger like GDB.
    2. Knowing the memory layout of a process will help us understand what
       exactly a segmentation fault (or segfault) is, and why they happen (or
       sometimes, more importantly) don't happen when they should. In brief,
       segfaults are the most common immediate cause a program to bomb.
    3. A knowledge of a program's memory space can often allow us to figure out
       the location of well-hidden bugs without the use of *print()* statements,
       a compiler or even GDBÔºÅIn the next section, which is a guest written
       piece by one my friends, Mark Kim, we'll see some real Sherlock Holmes
       style sleuthing. Mark homes in on a well hidden bug in somewhat lengthy
       code. It only took him about 5 or 10 minutes, and all he did was look at
       the program and use his knowledge of how a program's memory space works.
       It's really impressive!

So withoutfuther ado, let's take a look at how programs are laid out in memory.

* Virtual Memory (VM)
Whenever a process is created, the kernel provides a chunk of physical memory
which can be located anywhere at all. However, through the magic of virtual
memory(VM), the process believes it has all the memory on the computer. You
might have heard "virtual memory" in the context of using hard drive space as
memory when RAM runs out. That's called virtual memory too, but is largely
unrelated to what we're talking about. The VM we're concerned with consists of
the following principles:
    1. Each process is given physical memory called the process's virtual
       memory space.
    2. A process in unware of the details of its physical memory(i.e. where it
       physical resides). All the process knowns is how big the chunk is and
       that its chunk begins at address 0.
    3. Each process is unaware of any other chunks of VM belonging to other
       processes.
    4. Even if the process did know about other chunks of VM, it's physically
       prevented from accessing that memory.

Each time a process wants to read or write to memory, its request must be
translated from a VM address to a physical memory address. Conversely, when the
kernel needs to access the VM of a process, it must translate a physcial memory
address into a VM address. There are two major issues with this:
    1. Computers constantly access memory, so translations are very common;
       they must be lighting fast.
    2. How can the OS ensure that a process doesn't trample on another process's
       VM?
The answer to both questions lies in the fact that the OS doesn't manage VM by
itself: it gets help from the CPU. Many CPUs contain a device called an MMU: a
memory managementation unit. The MMU and the OS are jointly responsible for
manageing VM, translating between virtual and physical addresses, enforcing
permissions on which processes are allowed to access which memory locations, and
enforcing read/write permissions on sections of a VM space, even for process
that owns that space.

It used to be the case that Linux could only be ported to architectures that had
an MMU(so Linux wouldn't run on, say, an x286). However, in 1998, Linux was ported
to the 68000 which had no MMU. This paved the way for embedded Linux and Linux on
devices such has the Palm Pilot.

** Exercises
    1. Read a short Wikipedia blurb on the _MMU_.
    2. Optional: If you want to know more about VM, here's a [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/x86_64/mm.html?highlight=virtual%20memory][link]]. This is much
       more than you need to know.
