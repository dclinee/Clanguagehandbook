In this chapter, we extend the discussion of file I/O that we started in the previous
chapter.
    In continuing the discussion of the open() system call, we explain the concept of
atomicity-the notion that the actions performed by a system call are executed as a 
single uninterruptiable step. This is a nessarry requirement for the correct operation
of many system calls.
