* 1.Basics
** A. "set" assigns a value to a symbol
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (set 'fname "Dclinee")
#+end_src
#+RESULTS:
: Dclinee
Since quoting the symbol name is so common a second assignment opetator
was created, "setq".
** B. "setq" sets a value of a variable
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq fname "dclinee")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: dclinee
but can take multiple arguments
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq first_name "denng"
          secod_name "changlin")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: changlin
It returns the last value set.
* 2. ";" is the comment character
** ";" I'm a comment
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ; I'm a comment
  (setq my_name "dclinee") ; another comment too
#+end_src
** ";;" this is a comment
;; By the Emacs convention, comment on a line by itself starts with 2 semicolons
** ";;;" HEADER COMMENT
;; By the Emacs convention, comment starting with 3 semicolons is header comment.
