// preprocessor_directives.c -- introduce to CPP
/*
 The C preprocessor is a macro procesor that is used automatically by
the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation (
Proprocessor direcives are executed before compilation.). It is called
a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief
abbreviations for longer constructs. A macro is a segment of code which
is replaced by the value of macro. Macor is defined by #define directive.
