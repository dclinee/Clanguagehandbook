* The topic of Union in C
Like Structures, union is a user defined data type.
In union, all members share the smae memory location.
** Definition of Union in C
For example in the following C program, both x and y share the same location.
If we change x, we can see the changes being reflected in y.
#+begin_src  C
#include <stdio.h>
union test{int x, y;};
int main(void)
{
union test t;

t.x = 2;
printf("After making x = 2:\n x = %d\n y = %d\n", t.x, t.y);

t.y = 100;
printf("After making y = 100:\n x = %d\n y = %d\n", t.x, t.y);

return 0;
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| After | making |   x | = |   2: |
| x     | =      |   2 |   |      |
| y     | =      |   2 |   |      |
| After | making |   y | = | 100: |
| x     | =      | 100 |   |      |
| y     | =      | 100 |   |      |
